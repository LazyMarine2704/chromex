#Color detector for the visually impaired with Python.
Using OpenCV, Numpy, Pyttsx3 and Keyboard, we developed a script capable of recognizing the predominant color in an image frame captured by the camera.
With the development, we intend to make this script portable for a mobile device, to be better used by the visually impaired.
